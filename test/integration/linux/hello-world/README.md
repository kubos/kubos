# Kubos Linux Hello World

This is a simple application built on top of the [Kubos Linux Platform](https://github.com/kubos/kubos-linux-build) 
demonstrating the most basic Hello World! functionality.

The easiest way to get started building this is with the [KubOS SDK](http://docs.kubos.co/latest/md_docs_kubos-sdk.html).
