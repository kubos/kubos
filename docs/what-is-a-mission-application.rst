What is a Mission Application?
==============================

Mission applications include anything that makes decisions or governs autonomy on the satellite, as well as any other applications designed to address mission-specific concerns.

Applications can be used to accomplish anything on the system and are only limited by the computational or hardware capabilities of the spacecraft.

Autonomous Applications
-----------------------

Applications can be used to enable the satellite to act autonomously. Some basic versions of this are:

- Querying hardware services and storing telemetry
- Creating and broadcasting telemetry beacons that change depending on satellite state
- Controlling deployment procedures

Mission Operation Applications
------------------------------

Applications are also used to accomplish specific mission goals. Some possible examples are:

- Image analysis 
- Payload operation 
- Payload monitoring
