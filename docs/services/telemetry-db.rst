Telemetry Database Service
==========================

KubOS utilizes a `SQLite database <https://www.sqlite.org/about.html>`__ to store telemetry data generated by the
hardware and payload services until it is requested for transmission by the ground station.

SQLite only allows one process to make changes to a database at a time, so the telemetry database service acts as a 
single point of contact for interacting with the underlying telemetry database.

Interface Details
-----------------

Specific details about the available GraphQL queries can be found in the |telem-db| Rust docs.

.. note:: 

    At this time, the service can only query existing data in the database. New entries must be manually added.
    The service will be expanded to allow mutations to add new data in the upcoming release.
