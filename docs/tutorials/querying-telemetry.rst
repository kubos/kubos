Fetching Telemetry Data
=======================

At some point, users will want to fetch data which was written to the telemetry database
(for an example of this, see the :doc:`mission application <first-mission-app>` tutorial).

This tutorial will walk the user through the process of communicating with the
:doc:`telemetry database service <../ecosystem/services/telemetry-db>` in order to retrieve a desired set of
telemetry information.

Setup
-----

:doc:`Install the Kubos SDK <../sdk-docs/sdk-installing>` or set up the dependencies required for a
:doc:`local dev environment <../getting-started/local-setup>`

If you have not done so already, create a clone of the `KubOS source repo <https://github.com/kubos/kubos>`__::

    $ git clone https://github.com/kubos/kubos
    
**If you are using the SDK**, update all IP addresses in the ``tools/local_config.toml`` file,
changing them from ``127.0.0.1`` to ``0.0.0.0``, so that they are available :ref:`to your host machine <sdk-port-forward>`.

Navigate to the `kubos` source directory and run the following commands to start the telemetry
database service in the background (the services may need to be built first, which will take several
minutes to complete)::
  
    $ cargo run --bin telemetry-service -- -c tools/local_config.toml &

In order to have something to query, we'll need to seed the database.
We'll use ``curl`` to create some HTTP requests which will add data points to the telemetry
database.

.. note::

    The example commands will be referencing the telemetry database service port which is defined
    in the `kubos/tools/local_config.toml` file, 8020

From your development environment, run the following::

    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8020 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"query\":\"mutation {insert(subsystem:\\\"eps\\\",parameter:\\\"voltage\\\",value:\\\"5.0\\\"){success}}\"}"
    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8020 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"query\":\"mutation {insert(subsystem:\\\"eps\\\",parameter:\\\"voltage\\\",value:\\\"5.0\\\"){success}}\"}"
    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8020 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"query\":\"mutation {insert(subsystem:\\\"eps\\\",parameter:\\\"current\\\",value:\\\"0.1\\\"){success}}\"}"
    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8020 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"query\":\"mutation {insert(subsystem:\\\"eps\\\",parameter:\\\"current\\\",value:\\\"0.1\\\"){success}}\"}"
    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8020 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"query\":\"mutation {insert(subsystem:\\\"gps\\\",parameter:\\\"voltage\\\",value:\\\"3.3\\\"){success}}\"}"
    
Each of these commands should return the following::

    {"data":{"insert":{"success":true}}}
    
GraphiQL
--------

Please navigate to ``http://0.0.0.0:8020/graphiql`` in order to communicate with the telemetry service
for this tutorial.
If you are using the SDK, replace ``0.0.0.0`` with the :ref:`IP address you defined <sdk-port-forward>`
for your VM.

More information about the GraphiQL interface can be found :ref:`here <graphiql>`.

Schema
------

The ``telemetry`` query can be used to fetch a certain selection of data from the telemetry database.
It will return an array of database entries.

The query has the following schema::

    query {
        telemetry(timestampGe: Float, timestampLe: Float, subsystem: String, parameter: String, parameters: [String], limit: Integer): [{
            timestamp: Float!
            subsystem: String!
            parameter: String!
            value: String!
        }]
    }
    
Each of the input arguments acts as a filter for the database query:

    - timestampGe - Return entries with timestamps occurring on or after the given value
    - timestampLe - Return entries with timestamps occurring on or before the given value
    - subsystem - Return entries which match the given subsystem name
    - parameter - (Mutually exlusive with ``parameters``) Return entries which match the given
      parameter name
    - parameters - (Mutually exlusive with ``parameter``) Return entries which match any of the
      given parameter names
    - limit - Return only the first `n` entries found

Using the ``telemetry`` query without specifying any of the input arguments will result in all
entries in the telemetry database being returned.

The query returns an array of entries, each of which has the following response fields:

    - timestamp - The system time when the entry was recorded, in milliseconds since UNIX epoch
    - subsystem - The subsystem which generated the entry data
    - parameter - The specific data point the entry corresponds to
    - value - The value of the data point

Querying a Specific Subsystem
-----------------------------

In order to return only telemetry generated by a specific subsystem, we'll send a query using the
``subsystem`` input parameter.

For example, to get only telemetry from our (fake) EPS subsystem, we'll send the following query::

    {
      telemetry(subsystem: "eps") {
        timestamp
        subsystem
        parameter
        value
      }
    }
    
The request should return something like this::

    {
      "data": {
        "telemetry": [
          {
            "timestamp": 730.855591753,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "current",
            "value": "0.1"
          },
          {
            "timestamp": 730.21144042,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "current",
            "value": "0.1"
          },
          {
            "timestamp": 721.187618335,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "voltage",
            "value": "5.0"
          },
          {
            "timestamp": 688.450861332,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "voltage",
            "value": "5.0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Querying a Time Frame
---------------------

If we want to fetch the telemetry from a particular time frame, for example all telemetry occurring
between 1pm and 2pm, we'll use a combination of the ``timestampGe`` and ``timestampLe`` input
arguments.

.. note::

    In order to select a timeframe, it is helpful to know the current system time.
    This can be found by running the following command on the OBC: ``date +%s``.
    The command gets the current number of seconds since UNIX epoch, which matches the telemetry
    timestamp units.
    
Our request should look like this::

    {
      telemetry(timestampGe: 730.0, timestampLe: 731.0) {
        timestamp
        subsystem
        parameter
        value
      }
    }

This queries the system for telemetry in a 1 second window between 730 and 731, inclusive.
You will need to update the query for your specific timestamp range.

The response should look like this::

    {
      "data": {
        "telemetry": [
          {
            "timestamp": 730.855591753,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "current",
            "value": "0.1"
          },
          {
            "timestamp": 730.21144042,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "current",
            "value": "0.1"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Limiting the Results
--------------------

Let's say we only want to know the most recent voltage reading from our EPS subsystem.

We'll specify the ``subsystem`` and ``parameter`` input argument to narrow the filters down to the
subsystem and parameter we want.
We'll then also use the ``limit`` input argument to tell the telemetry database service to only
return the single most-recent entry.

Our request should look like this::

    {
      telemetry(subsystem: "eps", parameter: "voltage", limit: 1) {
        timestamp
        subsystem
        parameter
        value
      }
    }

The response should look like this::

    {
      "data": {
        "telemetry": [
          {
            "timestamp": 1573594014.6698866,
            "subsystem": "eps",
            "parameter": "voltage",
            "value": "5.0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
