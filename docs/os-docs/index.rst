Applications are user-level programs which can either be run as one-off executions or continuous
processes.

Mission applications include anything that makes decisions or governs autonomy on the satellite,
as well as any other applications designed to address mission-specific concerns.

More details about developing applications and how they can be used can be found in the
:doc:`mission development <../mission-dev/index>` section.

Services
--------

Kubos services are defined as any persistent process that is used to interact with the satellite.
Services rarely make decisions, but will allow the user to accomplish typical flight software tasks
such as telemetry storage, file management, shell access, and hardware interaction.

Kubos Linux
-----------

Kubos Linux is a custom Linux distribution designed with embedded devices in mind.

It focuses on including only drivers that are useful for space applications (eg.
I2C and SPI, rather than display drivers) and multi-layer system validation and
recovery logic.

Kubos Linux projects are built into binaries which will run as Linux user space
applications.
