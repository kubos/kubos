Kubos Linux Overview
====================

Introduction
------------

This is intended as a higher-level overview of the Kubos Linux
configuration, installation, and distribution for the Kubos clients'
embedded systems.

The high level components of every system will be: 

- Low-level bootloader/s
- U-Boot (mid-level bootloader. Loads Kubos Linux)
- KubOS Linux

Ideally, all the files will be delivered to the customer as a pre-baked
OBC. They'll just need to upload their user app files onto the board.

Software Components
-------------------

Bootloader #0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each OBC should have an initial bootloader preloaded in ROM. Its job is
to load the next bootloader from wherever it's living into SDRAM to
execute. We shouldn't have to interact directly with this much.

Bootloader #1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will be **highly non-portable**. The customer will either need to
provide one, or we'll need to create a custom bootloader for each board
that we come across. The main purpose of this bootloader is to load
U-Boot from wherever it is located in storage (NOR\|NAND\|DataFlash\|SD
@ address) into some location in SDRAM (probably by default, the very
beginning of SDRAM)

U-Boot
~~~~~~

`Wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot>`__

`Kubos U-Boot Repo <https://github.com/kubos/uboot>`__

U-Boot, at the most basic level, is responsible for loading the kernel from the
SD card into the SDRAM. However, it also provides a basic OS and CLI which can
be used to configure and debug the kernel before it's loaded.

Additionally, we've made some changes to allow us to use it as a kernel upgrade
and recovery system. At boot time it will check for available upgrade packages
or a corrupted Linux kernel and will then upgrade or rollback the kernel and
rootfs as necessary.

Kubos Linux Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kernel is actually composed of multiple components: the main linux
kernel, the libc library, and the command/utility library.

Using BuildRoot allows us to include tools like BusyBox and glibc with
the kernel and rootfs at build time.

Due to the portability of Linux, we are able to primarily use a single kernel
configuration to build the kernel for all target devices, barring a few
architecture-specific options (ARM, OMAP, etc).

zImage
^^^^^^

The zImage file is unpacked from the kernel file (which contains headers
for checksum validation) and then loaded into SDRAM by U-Boot and
contains a compressed version of the Linux kernel. The first few hundred
bytes of the file are not compressed and are responsible for
uncompressing the rest of the kernel and then kicking off the main
kernel execution.

Linux
^^^^^

`Linux 4.4 Overview <https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.4>`__

We're using Linux 4.4. This is the current long-term support version
(LTS) and will be supported until early 2022.

Glibc
^^^^^

`Overview <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>`__

We use the standard GNU C library to build our toolchains. We are
currently building using v2.23.

BusyBox
^^^^^^^

`Overview <https://busybox.net/about.html>`__

We're currently using v1.25.0.

BusyBox provides many of the common Linux console and shell commands,
but in a smaller package. If there are any commands or tools that need
to be added, they will likely be added through the busybox
configuration.

Currently enabled BusyBox commands:

::

    [, [[, addgroup, adduser, awk, cat, catv, chgrp, chmod, chown,
    chpasswd, chroot, cksum, clear, cp, cut, date, deallocvt, delgroup,
    deluser, df, dirname, du, dumpkmap, echo, egrep, env, expr, false,
    fgrep, find, fold, fsync, getty, grep, gzip, halt, hush, id, ifconfig,
    ifdown, ifup, init, inotifyd, ionice, iostat, ip, ipaddr, iplink,
    iproute, iprule, iptunnel, kill, killall, killall5, linuxrc, ln,
    loadkmap, login, logname, ls, lzcat, lzma, man, mkdir, mknod, mkpasswd,
    modinfo, more, mount, mv, nice, passwd, ping, pkill, poweroff,

    uname, uncompress, unlink, unlzma, unshare, unzip, uptime, usleep, vi,
    watch, watchdog, wc, which, whoami, yes

Device Tree Binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Site Page <https://www.devicetree.org/>`__

`Free Electrons
Tutorial <https://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/petazzoni-device-tree-dummies.pdf>`__

This is the memory and capability mapping file that tells Linux what
features/peripherals are available on the board and what memory location
they're located at. The human-readable files are \*.dts and \*.dtsi
(.dts-"include") and are converted into one device tree binary file
(\*.dtb) at build time.

This is a highly specific file for each board and has similar cases to
U-Boot. If we're lucky, a dtb file will already exist for the exact
board that we want. Most likely, there will be dts\* files for the CPU,
but not the exact board, so we'll have to modify a file that is close to
what we want. If we're unlucky, we'll have to write the dts\* files from
scratch, which will be painful and take a while.

Unfortunately, there isn't one great tutorial for writing and updating
device tree files. It's very much trial-and-error. I recommend looking
at the files for boards with similar processors and peripherals to see
examples for the various component definitions.

.. note::

    There is also an option to bake the data from the \*.dtb file
    directly into the zImage file. However, this capability is largely
    implemented as a support option for older boards and isn't something
    that we should need to use.

Connecting to the System
------------------------

All supported OBCs have a debug UART connection which is intended as the 
primary way to connect to the system console.

You'll need to establish a serial connection with the board in order to connect
to the console. Set up a serial connection to the board at a baudrate of 115200.

If you have a Kubos Vagrant image currently running, the FTDI connection will
be automatically passed through. You can use the included minicom configuration
to quickly connect to the board via the ``minicom kubos`` command in the VM's
command console.

.. note:: 

    If a Kubos Vagrant image is running, you will be unable to establish a serial
    connection on your host machine. You must instead connect to the device 
    through the VM.

::

    $ minicom kubos
    
If the board is already powered, hit the ``Enter`` key to display the login dialog.

If you power the board after starting the minicom session, the end of the boot
messages will look like this:

::

    Welcome to Kubos Linux
    Kubos login: 
    
By default, there are two user accounts available: "root" (the superuser), and "kubos" (a normal user).
Both have a default password of "Kubos123". For more information, see the :ref:`user-accounts` section.

User Space
----------

File System
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few key directories residing within the Kubos Linux user
space

/usr/sbin
^^^^^^^^^

All built-in Kubos services will reside in the /usr/sbin directory. This
covers things like the hardware and core services.

/home
^^^^^

All user-created files should reside under the /home directory. This
directory maps to a separate partition from the root file system. As a
result, all files here will remain unchanged if the system goes through
a kernel upgrade or downgrade.

The home directories of all user accounts, except root, should live
under this directory.

A special user 'system' exists to hold all user application binaries,
initialization scripts, and general flash transfer files.

--------------

**Any files not residing under the /home directory will be destroyed
during an upgrade/downgrade**

--------------

/home/system/usr/bin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All user-created applications will be loaded into this folder during the
``kubos flash`` process. The directory is included in the system's PATH,
so applications can then be called directly from anywhere, without
needing to know the full file path.

/home/system/usr/local/bin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All user-created non-application files will be loaded into this folder
during the ``kubos flash`` process. There is currently not a way to set
a destination folder for the ``kubos flash`` command, so if a different
endpoint directory is desired, the files will need to be manually moved.

/home/system/etc/init.d
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All user-application initialization scripts live under this directory.
The naming format is 'S{run-level}{application}'.

/upgrade
^^^^^^^^

All \*.itb files will reside in this directory. These files are used to
upgrade the Kubos Linux kernel and root file system.

Users
~~~~~

By default, there are only two users defined to the Kubos Linux system:
'root' and 'kubos'. To add more users, the Linux ``adduser`` or
``useradd`` commands should be used. Other common Linux commands related
to setting passwords and changing permissions are also available.

User home directories should be created as '/home/{username}'.

Base user permissions are determined by the default user profile and the
default device table, which can be found in the BuildRoot repository in
the system/device\_table.txt file.

**NOTE:** User definitions are stored in the /etc directory, which is
part of the root file system. As a result, any user definitions that are
added or changed will need to be re-added or changed after a system
upgrade or downgrade. This behavior will be changed in the future.


Upgrade Process
---------------

If you already have Kubos Linux installed on your system, but would like to
upgrade to the latest version, check out the :ref:`upgrade-installation` section. 
Alternatively, if you would like to rollback to a previously installed version, 
refer to the :ref:`upgrade-rollback` section.

Recovery Process
----------------

Should your Kubos Linux kernel become corrupted (as indicated by failing to
successfully boot into Linux several times), the system will automatically try
to recover during the next boot.

It will go through the following steps, if each is present (system will reboot
after attempting each step):

1. Reload the current version of Kubos Linux from the kpack\*.itb file
   in the upgrade partition
2. Reload the previous version of Kubos Linux from the kpack\*.itb file
   in the upgrade partition
3. Reload the base version of Kubos Linux from the kpack-base.itb file
   in the upgrade partition
4. Boot into the alternate OS

If none of these steps work, then the system will boot into the U-Boot CLI. From
here, some basic troubleshooting and debugging abilities should be available.

More information about the recovery process and architecture can be found in the
:doc:`Kubos Linux Recovery doc <kubos-linux-recovery>`

.. _env-reset:

Resetting the Environment
-------------------------

If the system goes through the full recovery process, you will need to reset the environment
in order to resume the normal boot process.

From the U-Boot CLI:

::

    $ env default bootcmd
    $ env default bootcount
    $ env default recovery_available
    $ saveenv
    $ reset
    
These commands will:

  - Restore the relevant environment variables to their default values
  - Save the new values to persistent storage
  - Reboot the system
  
As long as a valid kernel and rootfs are available, your system should now successfully boot
into Kubos Linux.
