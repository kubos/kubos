Using Lua with the Kubos SDK
============================

The Kubos SDK Vagrant box contains limited support for running Lua based
projects. This functionality is primarily used when running the communication
service, shell service, file service, or their respective clients.

.. note::

    All of the following instructions are assumed to be run inside of the
    Kubos SDK Vagrant environment.


Running Existing Projects
-------------------------

To run an existing lua project first navigate to the project`s folder::

    $ cd /home/vagrant/kubos/services/shell-service

Next use the `lit` tool to install any lua dependencies::

    $ lit install

Finally the project can be run using the `luvi-regular` binary::

    $ luvi-regular .

Any necessary command line arguments for the project may be passed like so::

    $ luvi-regular . -- arg1 arg2
