Getting Started with KubOS and Rust
===================================

This document will cover getting started using Rust for local KubOS development.
You will need to have the build dependencies listed in :ref:`local build dependencies <build-dependencies>`
installed prior to using Rust. After these dependencies have been installed,
you are ready to begin creating and running your own Rust projects.

New Project
-----------

A new Rust project can be created by running the following command::

   $ cargo new project_name

Cargo will create the project folder and a basic folder structure.
It is suggested that you create custom mission applications or services
outside of the Kubos source repo, preferably in your own project's repo folder.

Compiling and Running
---------------------

To compile the project use the normal Cargo build command::

    $ cargo build

This command should be run from within the project's directory, which was
generated by the ``cargo new`` command.

The resulting binary will be located in `{project directory}/target/debug/{project name}`.

The binary can be run locally using the ``cargo run`` command.
Any desired arguments can be passed to the underlying executable by placing them behind ``--`` like
so::

    $ cargo run -- -c config.toml

Making Rust Binaries Smaller
----------------------------

By default, Rust binaries can be quite large.
These are some steps which we recommend in order to drastically shrink the size of your compiled
application:

- Do a release build, rather than a debug build (``cargo build --release``)
- Add the following optimization args to your `Cargo.toml` file and recompile::

    [profile.release]
    lto = true
    opt-level = "z"
    panic = "abort"
    codegen-units = 1
    
- After the binary has been built, run ``arm-linux-strip /path/to/binary``

Next Steps
----------

Ready to create a mission application in Rust? Take a look at the :doc:`Python mission application <../tutorials/first-mission-app>`
tutorial for guidance in the construction of a mission application.
The `example rust mission application <https://github.com/kubos/kubos/tree/master/examples/rust-mission-app>`__ is a good model for a Rust-based mission application.
